<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
**GitHub Workflows for ACAI Terraform modules (with Python support)**

This repository provides reusable [GitHub Workflows][github_workflows_link] designed for ACAI Terraform modules, including integrated Python support. The workflows automate static code analysis, formatting, documentation checks, linting, and security scanning directly in GitHub Actions. 

## Referenced Github Actions

The reusable Github Workflows utilize the following external GitHub Actions:

**Core Actions:**
- [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) - Repository checkout functionality
- [`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) - Artifact upload and storage
- [`actions/setup-go`](https://github.com/actions/setup-go) - Go environment configuration
- [`actions/setup-python`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) - Python runtime setup
- [`actions/github-script`](https://github.com/actions/github-script) - Run JavaScript code within workflows
- [`ad-m/github-push-action`](https://github.com/ad-m/github-push-action) - Commit and push changes back to the repository from within workflows

**Terraform & Infrastructure:**
- [`hashicorp/setup-terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) - Terraform CLI installation
- [`terraform-docs/gh-actions`](https://github.com/terraform-docs/gh-actions) - Documentation generation
- [`terraform-linters/setup-tflint`](https://github.com/terraform-linters/setup-tflint) - Installs and configures TFLint for Terraform code analysis

**Code Quality & Security:**
- [`aquasecurity/trivy-action`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) - Standalone Trivy security scanning for vulnerabilities
- [`bridgecrewio/checkov-action`](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov-action) - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) static analysis and security scanning
- [`mikepenz/action-junit-report`](https://github.com/mikepenz/action-junit-report) - Converts test results to JUnit format and publishes them as workflow artifacts
